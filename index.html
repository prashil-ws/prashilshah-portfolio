                                        <p>At Tech Mahindra, I worked with Applied Materials, a global leader in materials engineering
                                            solutions used in the production of nearly every advanced chip and display in the world. During
                                            my time on the project, I played a key role in enhancing the overall performance and reliability
                                            of the application by introducing improvements that made it faster and more user-friendly. I
                                            also helped streamline the development and release process, making it easier to deliver updates
                                            consistently. Additionally, I supported efforts to modernize the system by contributing to its

                                            tools and systems used across various teams and applications. I helped develop and improve a
                                            shared framework to make application development more efficient and consistent. My work also
                                            involved simplifying how different parts of the system worked together, making it easier for
                                            teams to use common tools and resources. Additionally, I supported efforts to modernize the way

                                <p>
                                    Since my second year of engineering, I have been closely associated with CRY (Child Rights and You)—an
                                    organization
                                    that stands as a beacon of hope for underprivileged children across India. What began as a volunteering
                                    opportunity
                                    turned into a deep, ongoing commitment to shaping a better world, one child at a time.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For over four years, I actively participated in CRY’s initiatives—primarily teaching English and Math to
                                    children
                                    from nearby government schools who struggled with basic concepts. We believed that a strong foundation in
                                    education
                                    could pave the way for a lifetime of confidence and opportunity.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Beyond academics, our team organized several awareness drives within the community. These included campaigns on
                                    cleanliness and civic responsibility, the importance of education, and even sensitive topics like good touch and
                                    bad
                                    touch—ensuring children were not only informed but also empowered to protect themselves.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Even today, I remain affiliated with CRY, contributing to their workshops and events whenever possible. These
                                    experiences have shaped my perspective deeply, and they continue to inspire my belief in the power of
                                    compassion,
                                    community, and consistent effort.
